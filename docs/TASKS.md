### Implementation Notes
- BytesN types require explicit size specification in tests (BytesN<64>, BytesN<128>)
- Test environment timestamps can be 0, requiring adjusted assertions
- Storage modules need to be public in lib.rs for test access
- Constructor method name in contract differs from client expectations
- Soroban SDK client is auto-generated and available as CrowdfundingContractClient
